Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 20, 2025

Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use BishopAnimeTV. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

Information We Collect
Crash Reports and Analytics
We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and technical information about your device to improve app stability and performance. This may include:

Device type and model
Operating system version
Time and date of crashes
Technical crash information
App version
Your AniList username (for crash reports)
Anonymous Country-level geolocation data
Crash reports are associated with your AniList username to allow us to contact you if we need additional information about a specific issue. However, you can choose to anonymize your crash reports through the app settings, which will remove your AniList username from the reports.

Firebase Analytics collects anonymous usage data, including country-level geolocation information. This helps us understand how BishopAnimeTV is being used across different regions.

Third-Party Authentication and Integration
BishopAnimeTV allows you to authenticate with the following third-party services:

AniList
MyAnimeList
Discord
When using Discord Rich Presence (RPC) functionality, the app will share your current watching activity with Discord, including:

The series you are watching
The current episode number
This information is only shared while you are actively using BishopAnimeTV and have Discord RPC enabled.

While we facilitate these connections, we do not store your login credentials. Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device only. Please note that these third-party services may collect additional information according to their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review:
